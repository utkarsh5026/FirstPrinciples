 * üõ†Ô∏è Inside, we gather various services such as database management, reading analytics, and
 * session tracking, all wrapped up in a neat package. This way, components can easily access
 * the tools they need without any hassle! üöÄ
 *
 * üí° By using the useMemo hook, we ensure that our services are only created once,
 * optimizing performance and preventing unnecessary re-renders. This keeps our app
