# Binary Tree Level-Order Traversal: A Complete Guide for FAANG Interviews

## Understanding Trees from First Principles

Before diving into level-order traversal, let's establish what we're working with from the ground up.

> **Core Concept** : A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, traditionally called "left" and "right" children.

Think of a family tree, but inverted - the root (ancestor) is at the top, and descendants branch downward. Each person (node) can have at most two direct children.

```
        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \   \
    D   E   F
```

In this tree:

* **A** is the root (top-level node)
* **B** and **C** are A's children
* **D** ,  **E** , and **F** are leaf nodes (no children)

## What is Level-Order Traversal?

> **Definition** : Level-order traversal visits nodes level by level, from left to right within each level.

This is also called **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** for trees. Imagine reading a book - you read each line from left to right before moving to the next line.

For our example tree above:

* **Level 0** : A
* **Level 1** : B, C
* **Level 2** : D, E, F

 **Traversal order** : A → B → C → D → E → F

## Why Level-Order Traversal Matters in FAANG Interviews

> **Interview Reality** : Level-order traversal appears in 30-40% of tree-related problems in FAANG interviews because it tests multiple fundamental concepts simultaneously.

**Key reasons interviewers love it:**

1. **Queue understanding** - Tests your knowledge of FIFO data structures
2. **BFS vs DFS concepts** - Shows you understand different search strategies
3. **Level-based processing** - Many real-world problems require level-wise operations
4. **Space-time complexity analysis** - Clear trade-offs to discuss

## Basic Level-Order Traversal Implementation

Let's build this step by step, understanding every component:

```python
from collections import deque

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def level_order_basic(root):
    if not root:
        return []
  
    result = []
    queue = deque([root])
  
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        result.append(node.val)
      
        if node.left:
            queue.append(node.left)
        if node.right:
            queue.append(node.right)
  
    return result
```

**Line-by-line breakdown:**

1. **`from collections import deque`** : We import deque (double-ended queue) for O(1) operations on both ends
2. **TreeNode class** : Standard definition - each node stores a value and references to children
3. **Base case check** : If tree is empty, return empty list immediately
4. **Initialize data structures** :

* `result` list to store our traversal
* `queue` starting with just the root node

1. **Main loop** : Continue while queue has nodes to process
2. **Process current node** : Remove from front of queue, add value to result
3. **Add children** : If children exist, add them to back of queue (left first, then right)

> **Critical Insight** : The queue naturally maintains the left-to-right, level-by-level order because we add children from left to right and process nodes in FIFO order.

Let's trace through our example:

```
Initial: queue = [A], result = []
Step 1:  queue = [B, C], result = [A]
Step 2:  queue = [C, D, E], result = [A, B]  
Step 3:  queue = [D, E, F], result = [A, B, C]
Step 4:  queue = [E, F], result = [A, B, C, D]
Step 5:  queue = [F], result = [A, B, C, D, E]
Step 6:  queue = [], result = [A, B, C, D, E, F]
```

## Level-by-Level Variations

### 1. Level-Order with Sublists (Most Common Interview Pattern)

> **Problem** : Return nodes grouped by level, where each level is a separate list.

 **Expected output** : `[[A], [B, C], [D, E, F]]`

```python
def level_order_by_levels(root):
    if not root:
        return []
  
    result = []
    current_level = [root]
  
    while current_level:
        level_values = []
        next_level = []
      
        for node in current_level:
            level_values.append(node.val)
          
            if node.left:
                next_level.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                next_level.append(node.right)
      
        result.append(level_values)
        current_level = next_level
  
    return result
```

 **Key insight** : Instead of using a queue, we process entire levels at once using lists.

**Step-by-step execution:**

1. **Level 0** : `current_level = [A]` → `level_values = [A]` → `next_level = [B, C]`
2. **Level 1** : `current_level = [B, C]` → `level_values = [B, C]` → `next_level = [D, E, F]`
3. **Level 2** : `current_level = [D, E, F]` → `level_values = [D, E, F]` → `next_level = []`

### 2. Queue-Based Level Separation

> **Alternative approach** : Use queue but track level boundaries with size counting.

```python
def level_order_queue_method(root):
    if not root:
        return []
  
    result = []
    queue = deque([root])
  
    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)  # Nodes in current level
        current_level = []
      
        for i in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            current_level.append(node.val)
          
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
      
        result.append(current_level)
  
    return result
```

 **Critical understanding** : `level_size = len(queue)` captures exactly how many nodes are in the current level before we start adding the next level's nodes.

## Advanced Variations and Patterns

### 3. Zigzag Level-Order Traversal

> **Problem** : Traverse levels alternately - left-to-right, then right-to-left.

 **Expected output** : `[A, C, B, D, E, F]` (assuming our tree)

```python
def zigzag_level_order(root):
    if not root:
        return []
  
    result = []
    current_level = [root]
    left_to_right = True
  
    while current_level:
        level_values = []
        next_level = []
      
        for node in current_level:
            level_values.append(node.val)
          
            if node.left:
                next_level.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                next_level.append(node.right)
      
        # Reverse every other level
        if not left_to_right:
            level_values.reverse()
      
        result.extend(level_values)
        current_level = next_level
        left_to_right = not left_to_right
  
    return result
```

 **Pattern explanation** : We maintain a boolean flag that alternates each level, reversing the collected values when needed.

### 4. Right Side View of Binary Tree

> **Problem** : Return the rightmost node value from each level (what you'd see looking from the right side).

```python
def right_side_view(root):
    if not root:
        return []
  
    result = []
    current_level = [root]
  
    while current_level:
        # Last node in current level is rightmost
        result.append(current_level[-1].val)
      
        next_level = []
        for node in current_level:
            if node.left:
                next_level.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                next_level.append(node.right)
      
        current_level = next_level
  
    return result
```

 **Key insight** : The rightmost node in each level is simply the last node we process in that level.

### 5. Find Largest Value in Each Row

```python
def largest_values(root):
    if not root:
        return []
  
    result = []
    current_level = [root]
  
    while current_level:
        level_max = float('-inf')
        next_level = []
      
        for node in current_level:
            level_max = max(level_max, node.val)
          
            if node.left:
                next_level.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                next_level.append(node.right)
      
        result.append(level_max)
        current_level = next_level
  
    return result
```

## Memory and Time Complexity Analysis

> **Space Complexity Deep Dive** : Understanding memory usage is crucial for optimization discussions.

 **Time Complexity** : O(n) for all variations

* We visit each node exactly once
* Each node is added to and removed from our data structure once

 **Space Complexity** : O(w) where w is maximum width of tree

* **Best case** (completely unbalanced): O(1)
* **Worst case** (complete binary tree): O(n/2) = O(n)

**Visual representation of space usage:**

```
Complete Binary Tree:
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   / \   / \
  4   5 6   7

Level 0: 1 node  in memory
Level 1: 2 nodes in memory  
Level 2: 4 nodes in memory ← Maximum width
```

For a complete binary tree with n nodes, the last level can have up to n/2 nodes, making space complexity O(n).

## Interview Optimization Techniques

### 1. Early Termination Patterns

```python
def find_level_with_target(root, target):
    """Find which level contains target value"""
    if not root:
        return -1
  
    current_level = [root]
    level = 0
  
    while current_level:
        for node in current_level:
            if node.val == target:
                return level
      
        # Build next level only if target not found
        next_level = []
        for node in current_level:
            if node.left:
                next_level.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                next_level.append(node.right)
      
        current_level = next_level
        level += 1
  
    return -1
```

### 2. Two-Queue Optimization

> **Memory optimization** : Use two queues to avoid creating new lists repeatedly.

```python
def level_order_two_queues(root):
    if not root:
        return []
  
    result = []
    current = deque([root])
    next_level = deque()
    level_values = []
  
    while current:
        node = current.popleft()
        level_values.append(node.val)
      
        if node.left:
            next_level.append(node.left)
        if node.right:
            next_level.append(node.right)
      
        # When current level is empty, move to next
        if not current:
            result.append(level_values)
            level_values = []
            current, next_level = next_level, current
  
    return result
```

## Common Interview Pitfalls and Solutions

> **Pitfall #1** : Modifying queue/list while iterating

**Wrong approach:**

```python
# DON'T DO THIS
while queue:
    node = queue.popleft()
    if node.left:
        queue.append(node.left)  # Modifying during iteration
```

 **Why it fails** : You'll process nodes from multiple levels in one iteration.

 **Correct approach** : Always separate level processing from child addition.

> **Pitfall #2** : Forgetting edge cases

Essential edge cases to handle:

* Empty tree (root is None)
* Single node tree
* Completely unbalanced tree (linked list structure)
* Tree with missing children (not complete)

## Practice Problems and Patterns

### FAANG-Style Problem: Average of Levels

> **Problem** : Calculate the average value of nodes in each level.

```python
def average_of_levels(root):
    if not root:
        return []
  
    result = []
    current_level = [root]
  
    while current_level:
        level_sum = 0
        level_count = len(current_level)
        next_level = []
      
        for node in current_level:
            level_sum += node.val
          
            if node.left:
                next_level.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                next_level.append(node.right)
      
        result.append(level_sum / level_count)
        current_level = next_level
  
    return result
```

**Interview discussion points:**

* **Overflow consideration** : For very large trees with large values, consider using floating-point arithmetic
* **Precision** : Discuss whether exact fractions or floating-point approximations are required

## Key Interview Talking Points

> **What interviewers want to hear:**

1. **Algorithm choice justification** : "I'm using BFS because we need to process nodes level by level, which naturally fits the FIFO property of queues."
2. **Space complexity trade-offs** : "The space complexity is O(w) where w is the maximum width. For a balanced tree, this is roughly O(n/2), but for a skewed tree, it could be O(1)."
3. **Alternative approaches** : "We could also solve this with DFS by tracking the current level, but BFS is more intuitive for level-order problems."
4. **Optimization opportunities** : "If we only need specific information from each level (like just the rightmost node), we can optimize by not storing all level values."

Understanding these level-order traversal patterns gives you a solid foundation for tackling tree problems in FAANG interviews. The key is recognizing when a problem requires level-wise processing and then adapting the basic template to the specific requirements.
