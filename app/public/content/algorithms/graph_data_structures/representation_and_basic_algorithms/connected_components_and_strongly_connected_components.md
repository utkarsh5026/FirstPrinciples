# Connected Components & Strongly Connected Components: A Deep Dive for FAANG Interviews

## Understanding Graph Connectivity from First Principles

Before diving into connected components, let's establish the fundamental concept of **connectivity** in graph theory.

> **Core Principle** : Two nodes in a graph are "connected" if there exists a path between them. A path is a sequence of edges that allows you to travel from one node to another.

Think of this like a road network. If you can drive from your house to a friend's house (possibly taking multiple roads), then your locations are connected in the road network.

### The Foundation: What Makes Nodes Connected?

In graph theory, connectivity depends on the type of graph:

 **Undirected Graphs** : Two nodes are connected if you can travel between them in either direction.

```
A --- B --- C
```

Here, A and C are connected through B.

 **Directed Graphs** : Two nodes are connected if you can travel from one to another following the direction of edges.

```
A → B → C
```

Here, you can go from A to C, but not from C to A.

## Connected Components in Undirected Graphs

> **Definition** : A connected component is a maximal set of vertices such that every pair of vertices in the set is connected by a path.

### First Principles Understanding

Imagine you have a social network where friendships are mutual (undirected). A connected component would be a group of people where:

1. Everyone in the group can reach everyone else through mutual friends
2. No one outside the group is connected to anyone inside the group

### Visual Example

```
Component 1:     Component 2:     Component 3:
    A                F                 I
   / \              / \                |
  B   C            G   H               J
     /
    D
```

In this graph:

* Component 1: {A, B, C, D} - all interconnected
* Component 2: {F, G, H} - all interconnected
* Component 3: {I, J} - connected to each other
* Each component is isolated from others

### Algorithm: Finding Connected Components using DFS

The most intuitive approach uses Depth-First Search (DFS):

```python
def find_connected_components(graph):
    """
    Find all connected components in an undirected graph
  
    Args:
        graph: Dictionary representing adjacency list
        Example: {0: [1, 2], 1: [0], 2: [0, 3], 3: [2]}
  
    Returns:
        List of components, where each component is a list of nodes
    """
    visited = set()
    components = []
  
    def dfs(node, current_component):
        """
        Depth-first search to explore all nodes in current component
      
        Args:
            node: Current node being visited
            current_component: List to store nodes in current component
        """
        visited.add(node)
        current_component.append(node)
      
        # Visit all unvisited neighbors
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor, current_component)
  
    # Check each node to find new components
    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            current_component = []
            dfs(node, current_component)
            components.append(current_component)
  
    return components

# Example usage
graph = {
    0: [1, 2],
    1: [0],
    2: [0, 3], 
    3: [2],
    4: [5],
    5: [4],
    6: []  # isolated node
}

components = find_connected_components(graph)
print(components)  # [[0, 1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]]
```

### Code Explanation

 **Step-by-step breakdown** :

1. **Initialization** : We create a `visited` set to track explored nodes and a `components` list to store our results.
2. **DFS Function** : The inner `dfs` function explores all reachable nodes from a starting point:

* Mark current node as visited
* Add it to the current component
* Recursively visit all unvisited neighbors

1. **Main Loop** : For each unvisited node, we start a new DFS, which finds one complete connected component.
2. **Why this works** : DFS naturally explores all reachable nodes from a starting point, which by definition forms exactly one connected component.

### Time and Space Complexity

> **Time Complexity** : O(V + E) where V is vertices and E is edges
>
> * We visit each vertex once: O(V)
> * We examine each edge once: O(E)

> **Space Complexity** : O(V) for the visited set and recursion stack

---

## Strongly Connected Components in Directed Graphs

Now we move to directed graphs, where the concept becomes more nuanced.

> **Definition** : A strongly connected component (SCC) is a maximal set of vertices such that there is a directed path from every vertex to every other vertex in the set.

### First Principles Understanding

Think of a directed graph as a one-way street system. A strongly connected component is like a neighborhood where:

1. You can drive from any intersection to any other intersection within the neighborhood
2. Following one-way streets only
3. The neighborhood is maximal (you can't add more intersections while maintaining this property)

### Visual Example

```
     1 → 2
     ↑   ↓
     4 ← 3
   
     5 → 6
         ↓
         7
```

Analysis:

* **SCC 1** : {1, 2, 3, 4} - you can reach any node from any other node
* **SCC 2** : {5} - only connects outward
* **SCC 3** : {6} - only connects outward
* **SCC 4** : {7} - no outgoing connections

### Kosaraju's Algorithm: The Standard Approach

Kosaraju's algorithm is the most commonly asked algorithm in FAANG interviews for finding SCCs.

> **Key Insight** : If we can find the "finishing order" of DFS and then do DFS on the transpose graph in reverse finishing order, we'll find SCCs.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Step 1** : Perform DFS on original graph and record finishing times
2. **Step 2** : Create transpose graph (reverse all edges)
3. **Step 3** : Perform DFS on transpose graph in decreasing order of finishing times

### Implementation

```python
def kosaraju_scc(graph):
    """
    Find strongly connected components using Kosaraju's algorithm
  
    Args:
        graph: Dictionary representing adjacency list of directed graph
        Example: {0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [0, 3], 3: []}
  
    Returns:
        List of SCCs, where each SCC is a list of nodes
    """
    # Step 1: Get finishing order using DFS
    def dfs1(node, visited, stack):
        """First DFS to get finishing order"""
        visited.add(node)
      
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs1(neighbor, visited, stack)
      
        # Add to stack when finishing (post-order)
        stack.append(node)
  
    # Step 2: Create transpose graph
    def create_transpose():
        """Create graph with all edges reversed"""
        transpose = {}
      
        # Initialize all nodes
        for node in graph:
            transpose[node] = []
      
        # Reverse all edges
        for node in graph:
            for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
                if neighbor not in transpose:
                    transpose[neighbor] = []
                transpose[neighbor].append(node)
      
        return transpose
  
    # Step 3: DFS on transpose in reverse finishing order
    def dfs2(node, visited, current_scc, transpose):
        """Second DFS to find SCC"""
        visited.add(node)
        current_scc.append(node)
      
        for neighbor in transpose.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs2(neighbor, visited, current_scc, transpose)
  
    # Execute Kosaraju's algorithm
  
    # Phase 1: First DFS to get finishing order
    visited = set()
    finishing_stack = []
  
    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs1(node, visited, finishing_stack)
  
    # Phase 2: Create transpose graph
    transpose = create_transpose()
  
    # Phase 3: Second DFS on transpose
    visited = set()
    sccs = []
  
    # Process nodes in reverse finishing order
    while finishing_stack:
        node = finishing_stack.pop()
        if node not in visited:
            current_scc = []
            dfs2(node, visited, current_scc, transpose)
            sccs.append(current_scc)
  
    return sccs

# Example usage
directed_graph = {
    0: [1],
    1: [2], 
    2: [0, 3],
    3: [4],
    4: [5, 7],
    5: [6],
    6: [4],
    7: []
}

sccs = kosaraju_scc(directed_graph)
print("Strongly Connected Components:", sccs)
```

### Detailed Code Explanation

 **Phase 1 - Finding Finishing Order** :

* We perform DFS and use a stack to record when we "finish" processing each node
* Finishing time is when we've explored all descendants of a node
* This gives us topological ordering of SCCs

 **Phase 2 - Creating Transpose** :

* Transpose graph has all edges reversed
* If original had edge A→B, transpose has B→A
* This reversal is crucial for the algorithm's correctness

 **Phase 3 - Finding SCCs** :

* We process nodes in reverse finishing order from Phase 1
* Each DFS on the transpose finds exactly one SCC
* The transpose ensures we only reach nodes within the same SCC

### Why Kosaraju's Algorithm Works

> **Mathematical Insight** : In the transpose graph, if we start DFS from the node with the highest finishing time, we can only reach nodes within the same SCC. This is because the transpose breaks connections between different SCCs while preserving internal SCC structure.

### Time and Space Complexity

> **Time Complexity** : O(V + E)
>
> * First DFS: O(V + E)
> * Creating transpose: O(V + E)
> * Second DFS: O(V + E)

> **Space Complexity** : O(V) for visited sets, stack, and transpose graph

## Alternative Algorithm: Tarjan's SCC Algorithm

For completeness, here's Tarjan's algorithm, which finds SCCs in a single pass:

```python
def tarjan_scc(graph):
    """
    Find SCCs using Tarjan's algorithm (single DFS pass)
  
    This algorithm uses the concept of "low-link" values to detect
    when we've found the root of an SCC during DFS traversal.
    """
    # Initialize tracking variables
    index_counter = [0]  # Use list to modify in nested function
    stack = []
    lowlink = {}
    index = {}
    on_stack = set()
    sccs = []
  
    def strongconnect(node):
        """
        DFS function that finds SCCs using low-link values
      
        Low-link value: smallest index reachable from node
        """
        # Set the depth index and low-link for node
        index[node] = index_counter[0]
        lowlink[node] = index_counter[0]
        index_counter[0] += 1
      
        # Push node onto stack
        stack.append(node)
        on_stack.add(node)
      
        # Visit all neighbors
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in index:
                # Neighbor not visited, recurse
                strongconnect(neighbor)
                lowlink[node] = min(lowlink[node], lowlink[neighbor])
            elif neighbor in on_stack:
                # Neighbor is on stack (back edge in SCC)
                lowlink[node] = min(lowlink[node], index[neighbor])
      
        # If node is root of SCC, pop the SCC from stack
        if lowlink[node] == index[node]:
            current_scc = []
            while True:
                w = stack.pop()
                on_stack.remove(w)
                current_scc.append(w)
                if w == node:
                    break
            sccs.append(current_scc)
  
    # Run DFS from all unvisited nodes
    for node in graph:
        if node not in index:
            strongconnect(node)
  
    return sccs
```

## FAANG Interview Perspectives and Common Questions

### Typical Interview Questions

 **Level 1 (Basic Understanding)** :

1. "Find the number of connected components in an undirected graph"
2. "Determine if two nodes are in the same connected component"

 **Level 2 (Implementation)** :
3. "Implement an algorithm to find all strongly connected components"

### Example Interview Problem Solution

 **Problem** : Given a directed graph, determine if it's strongly connected (forms one SCC).

```python
def is_strongly_connected(graph):
    """
    Check if entire directed graph forms one SCC
  
    Strategy: Use Kosaraju's algorithm and check if we get exactly 1 SCC
    """
    sccs = kosaraju_scc(graph)
  
    # Graph is strongly connected if it has exactly one SCC
    # and that SCC contains all nodes
    all_nodes = set(graph.keys())
    for neighbors in graph.values():
        all_nodes.update(neighbors)
  
    return len(sccs) == 1 and len(sccs[0]) == len(all_nodes)

# Alternative efficient approach for this specific problem
def is_strongly_connected_optimized(graph):
    """
    Optimized approach: 
    1. Check if all nodes reachable from any node
    2. Check if all nodes reachable in transpose graph
    """
    if not graph:
        return True
  
    # Pick any node as starting point
    start_node = next(iter(graph))
  
    # Check if all nodes reachable from start_node
    def is_all_reachable(g, start):
        visited = set()
        stack = [start]
      
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            if node not in visited:
                visited.add(node)
                stack.extend(g.get(node, []))
      
        all_nodes = set(g.keys())
        for neighbors in g.values():
            all_nodes.update(neighbors)
      
        return len(visited) == len(all_nodes)
  
    # Check reachability in original graph
    if not is_all_reachable(graph, start_node):
        return False
  
    # Create and check reachability in transpose
    transpose = {}
    for node in graph:
        transpose[node] = []
  
    for node, neighbors in graph.items():
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            if neighbor not in transpose:
                transpose[neighbor] = []
            transpose[neighbor].append(node)
  
    return is_all_reachable(transpose, start_node)
```

### Interview Tips and Common Pitfalls

    """
    Given n people, and is_connected[i][j] = 1 if person i knows person j,
    find total number of friend circles.
