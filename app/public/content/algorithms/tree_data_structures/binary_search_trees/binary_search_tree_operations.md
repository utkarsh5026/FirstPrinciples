# Binary Search Trees: From First Principles to FAANG Mastery

Let me take you on a comprehensive journey through Binary Search Trees (BSTs), building from the ground up to master these fundamental data structures that appear in virtually every FAANG technical interview.

## Understanding Trees: The Foundation

Before we dive into Binary Search Trees, let's establish what a tree actually is from first principles.

> **Core Concept** : A tree is a hierarchical data structure that mimics the branching structure of a real tree, but inverted - with the root at the top and leaves at the bottom.

 **Why Trees Matter in Computing** :

* They represent hierarchical relationships naturally
* They enable efficient searching, insertion, and deletion
* They form the backbone of file systems, databases, and decision-making algorithms

**Tree Terminology** (Essential for interviews):

```
       Root (A)
      /        \
   Node (B)   Node (C)
   /    \        \
Leaf(D) Leaf(E) Leaf(F)
```

* **Root** : The topmost node (A)
* **Parent** : A node with children (A is parent of B and C)
* **Child** : A node with a parent (B and C are children of A)
* **Leaf** : A node with no children (D, E, F)
* **Height** : Longest path from root to leaf
* **Depth** : Distance from root to a specific node

## What Makes a Binary Search Tree Special?

A **Binary Search Tree** is a binary tree (each node has at most 2 children) with a crucial ordering property:

> **BST Property** : For every node N:
>
> * All values in the left subtree < N's value
> * All values in the right subtree > N's value
> * This property holds recursively for every subtree

 **Visual Example** :

```
        8
       / \
      3   10
     / \    \
    1   6    14
       / \   /
      4   7 13
```

Let's verify this is a valid BST:

* Node 8: Left subtree (3,1,6,4,7) all < 8, Right subtree (10,14,13) all > 8 ✓
* Node 3: Left subtree (1) < 3, Right subtree (6,4,7) > 3 ✓
* Node 6: Left subtree (4) < 6, Right subtree (7) > 6 ✓

## BST Node Structure: Building Blocks

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val      # The data stored in this node
        self.left = left    # Reference to left child
        self.right = right  # Reference to right child
```

 **Why this structure works** :

* `val`: Stores the actual data
* `left`: Points to smaller values (maintains BST property)
* `right`: Points to larger values (maintains BST property)
* `None`: Represents absence of a child (base case for recursion)

## Operation 1: Search - Finding the Needle in the Haystack

### The Logic Behind BST Search

> **Key Insight** : The BST property allows us to eliminate half the search space at each step, similar to binary search on sorted arrays.

 **Search Algorithm Flow** :

1. Start at root
2. Compare target with current node
3. If equal → Found!
4. If target < current → Go left
5. If target > current → Go right
6. If we reach `None` → Not found

### Search Implementation

```python
def search_bst(root, target):
    # Base case: empty tree or reached a leaf's child
    if not root:
        return None
  
    # Found the target
    if root.val == target:
        return root
  
    # Target is smaller, search left subtree
    elif target < root.val:
        return search_bst(root.left, target)
  
    # Target is larger, search right subtree
    else:
        return search_bst(root.right, target)
```

 **Code Breakdown** :

* **Line 3** : `if not root` handles the case where we've gone past a leaf node
* **Line 6** : Direct comparison - if we found it, return the node
* **Line 9** : Leverage BST property - smaller values are always left
* **Line 13** : Leverage BST property - larger values are always right

### Search Example Walkthrough

Let's search for value `6` in our BST:

```
        8         ← Start here, 6 < 8, go left
       / \
      3   10      ← Now at 3, 6 > 3, go right
     / \    \
    1   6    14   ← Now at 6, 6 == 6, FOUND!
       / \   /
      4   7 13
```

 **Step-by-step execution** :

1. `search_bst(8, 6)`: 6 < 8, call `search_bst(3, 6)`
2. `search_bst(3, 6)`: 6 > 3, call `search_bst(6, 6)`
3. `search_bst(6, 6)`: 6 == 6, return node with value 6

 **Time Complexity** : O(h) where h is height

* **Best case** : O(log n) for balanced tree
* **Worst case** : O(n) for skewed tree

## Operation 2: Insertion - Adding New Elements

### The Insertion Strategy

> **Core Principle** : Find the correct position that maintains the BST property, then attach the new node as a leaf.

 **Insertion Algorithm** :

1. Start at root
2. Compare new value with current node
3. If smaller → go left, if larger → go right
4. When you reach `None` → insert here
5. Maintain parent-child relationships

### Insertion Implementation

```python
def insert_bst(root, val):
    # Base case: empty tree or found insertion point
    if not root:
        return TreeNode(val)
  
    # Avoid duplicates (optional, depends on requirements)
    if val == root.val:
        return root
  
    # Insert in left subtree
    if val < root.val:
        root.left = insert_bst(root.left, val)
  
    # Insert in right subtree
    else:
        root.right = insert_bst(root.right, val)
  
    return root
```

 **Code Analysis** :

* **Line 3** : Creates new node when we find the insertion point
* **Line 6-7** : Handle duplicates (interview clarification needed)
* **Line 10-11** : Recursive insertion maintaining BST property
* **Line 14-15** : Recursive insertion for larger values
* **Line 17** : Return root to maintain tree structure

### Insertion Example

Let's insert value `5` into our BST:

 **Before insertion** :

```
        8
       / \
      3   10
     / \    \
    1   6    14
       / \   /
      4   7 13
```

 **Insertion path for 5** :

```
        8         ← 5 < 8, go left
       / \
      3   10      ← 5 > 3, go right
     / \    \
    1   6    14   ← 5 < 6, go left
       / \   /
      4   7 13    ← 5 > 4, go right (but 4.right is None)
```

 **After insertion** :

```
        8
       / \
      3   10
     / \    \
    1   6    14
       / \   /
      4   7 13
       \
        5      ← New node inserted here
```

 **Step-by-step execution** :

1. `insert_bst(8, 5)`: 5 < 8, recurse left
2. `insert_bst(3, 5)`: 5 > 3, recurse right
3. `insert_bst(6, 5)`: 5 < 6, recurse left
4. `insert_bst(4, 5)`: 5 > 4, recurse right
5. `insert_bst(None, 5)`: Create new TreeNode(5)

## Operation 3: Deletion - The Most Complex Operation

Deletion is the trickiest BST operation because removing a node can break the tree structure. We need to handle three distinct cases.

### Case 1: Deleting a Leaf Node

 **Strategy** : Simply remove the node - no children to worry about.

```
Before: 8 → 3 → 1    After: 8 → 3 → None
        Delete 1             (1 is gone)
```

### Case 2: Deleting Node with One Child

 **Strategy** : Replace the node with its only child.

```
Before:     6          After:     6
           /                     /
          4                     2
         /                       \
        2                         3
         \
          3
        Delete 4
```

### Case 3: Deleting Node with Two Children

> **Critical Insight** : We need to find a replacement that maintains the BST property. The **inorder successor** (smallest value in right subtree) is perfect for this.

 **Why inorder successor works** :

* It's larger than all nodes in the left subtree
* It's smaller than all other nodes in the right subtree
* It maintains the BST property perfectly

### Complete Deletion Implementation

```python
def delete_bst(root, val):
    # Base case: value not found
    if not root:
        return root
  
    # Navigate to the node to delete
    if val < root.val:
        root.left = delete_bst(root.left, val)
    elif val > root.val:
        root.right = delete_bst(root.right, val)
  
    # Found the node to delete
    else:
        # Case 1: No children (leaf node)
        if not root.left and not root.right:
            return None
      
        # Case 2: One child
        elif not root.left:
            return root.right
        elif not root.right:
            return root.left
      
        # Case 3: Two children
        else:
            # Find inorder successor (smallest in right subtree)
            successor = find_min(root.right)
          
            # Replace current node's value with successor's value
            root.val = successor.val
          
            # Delete the successor from right subtree
            root.right = delete_bst(root.right, successor.val)
  
    return root

def find_min(node):
    """Find the minimum value node in a subtree"""
    current = node
    while current.left:
        current = current.left
    return current
```

 **Code Breakdown** :

* **Lines 6-9** : Navigate to target node using BST property
* **Lines 13-14** : Case 1 - Leaf deletion, return None
* **Lines 17-20** : Case 2 - Single child, return the child
* **Lines 25** : Find inorder successor using helper function
* **Lines 28** : Replace value instead of restructuring pointers
* **Lines 31** : Delete successor from its original position

### Deletion Example: Two Children Case

Let's delete node `3` from our BST:

 **Original tree** :

```
        8
       / \
      3   10      ← Delete this node (has two children)
     / \    \
    1   6    14
       / \   /
      4   7 13
```

 **Step 1** : Find inorder successor of `3`

* Successor = smallest in right subtree of 3
* Go to node 6, then keep going left until we can't
* Successor = node 4

 **Step 2** : Replace node 3's value with 4

```
        8
       / \
      4   10      ← Value changed from 3 to 4
     / \    \
    1   6    14
       / \   /
      4   7 13   ← Original 4 still here, needs deletion
```

 **Step 3** : Delete original node 4 (now a leaf)

```
        8
       / \
      4   10      ← Final result
     / \    \
    1   6    14
         \   /
          7 13    ← Node 4 removed
```

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

> **Interview Gold** : Understanding complexity in different scenarios is crucial for FAANG interviews.

### Time Complexities

| Operation | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
| --------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Search    | O(log n)  | O(log n)     | O(n)       |
| Insert    | O(log n)  | O(log n)     | O(n)       |
| Delete    | O(log n)  | O(log n)     | O(n)       |

 **Best/Average Case** : Balanced tree (height ≈ log n)
 **Worst Case** : Skewed tree (becomes a linked list)

### Space Complexity

 **Recursive implementations** : O(h) due to call stack

* Best case: O(log n)
* Worst case: O(n)

 **Iterative implementations** : O(1) space complexity

## Common FAANG Interview Patterns

### Pattern 1: BST Validation

```python
def is_valid_bst(root, min_val=float('-inf'), max_val=float('inf')):
    """
    Validate if tree maintains BST property
    Uses bounds checking approach
    """
    if not root:
        return True
  
    # Check if current node violates BST property
    if root.val <= min_val or root.val >= max_val:
        return False
  
    # Recursively validate subtrees with updated bounds
    return (is_valid_bst(root.left, min_val, root.val) and
            is_valid_bst(root.right, root.val, max_val))
```

### Pattern 2: Finding Kth Smallest Element

```python
def kth_smallest(root, k):
    """
    Find kth smallest element using inorder traversal
    Inorder traversal of BST gives sorted sequence
    """
    def inorder(node):
        if not node:
            return []
        return inorder(node.left) + [node.val] + inorder(node.right)
  
    sorted_values = inorder(root)
    return sorted_values[k-1]  # k is 1-indexed
```

## Key Interview Tips
