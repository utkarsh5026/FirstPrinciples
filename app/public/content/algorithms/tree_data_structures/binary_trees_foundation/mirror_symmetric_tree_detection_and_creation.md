# Mirror/Symmetric Tree Detection and Creation: A Deep Dive from First Principles

Let's embark on a comprehensive journey through one of the most elegant problems in computer science - understanding and working with mirror trees. This concept frequently appears in FAANG interviews and requires a solid understanding of tree traversal, recursion, and spatial reasoning.

## Understanding the Foundation: What is a Mirror Tree?

> **Core Definition** : A mirror tree (also called a symmetric tree) is a binary tree that appears identical when viewed in a mirror. In other words, the left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree.

Let's start with the most fundamental question: what does "mirror" actually mean in the context of binary trees?

### Visual Foundation

```
    Original Tree          Mirror Tree
        1                      1
       / \                    / \
      2   3                  3   2
     / \ / \                / \ / \
    4  5 6  7              7  6 5  4
```

When we "mirror" a tree, we're essentially flipping it horizontally - every left child becomes a right child, and every right child becomes a left child.

### The Mathematical Foundation

> **Key Insight** : A tree is symmetric if and only if it's identical to its own mirror image.

This leads us to a crucial realization: we don't actually need to create the mirror image and compare. Instead, we can check if the tree has the symmetric property directly.

## The Anatomy of Symmetry

### Properties of a Symmetric Tree

Before diving into algorithms, let's establish the fundamental properties:

```
Symmetric Tree Example:
        1
       / \
      2   2
     / \ / \
    3  4 4  3
```

> **Property 1** : The root can be any value (it's on the axis of symmetry)
>
> **Property 2** : For any node at position (level, index), its mirror node at (level, mirror_index) must have the same value
>
> **Property 3** : The left subtree of any node must be a mirror image of the right subtree of its symmetric counterpart

### Breaking Down the Symmetry Check

Let's understand what we need to verify at each level:

```
Level 0:    1       ✓ (root is symmetric by definition)
Level 1:   2 2      ✓ (left.val == right.val)
Level 2:  3 4 4 3   ✓ (outer values match: 3==3, inner values match: 4==4)
```

## Algorithm 1: Recursive Mirror Detection

### The Recursive Insight

> **Core Idea** : Two trees are mirrors of each other if their roots have the same value AND the left subtree of the first tree is a mirror of the right subtree of the second tree, AND the right subtree of the first tree is a mirror of the left subtree of the second tree.

Let's implement this step by step:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def is_symmetric(root):
    """
    Check if a binary tree is symmetric (mirror image of itself)
  
    Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes
    Space Complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the tree (recursion stack)
    """
    if not root:
        return True
  
    def are_mirrors(left_node, right_node):
        # Base case: both nodes are None
        if not left_node and not right_node:
            return True
      
        # One node is None, the other isn't
        if not left_node or not right_node:
            return False
      
        # Both nodes exist: check value equality and recursive mirror property
        return (left_node.val == right_node.val and
                are_mirrors(left_node.left, right_node.right) and
                are_mirrors(left_node.right, right_node.left))
  
    return are_mirrors(root.left, root.right)
```

### Code Deep Dive

Let's break down every part of this algorithm:

**1. The Base Cases:**

```python
if not left_node and not right_node:
    return True
```

When both nodes are `None`, they're perfectly symmetric - absence mirrors absence.

**2. The Asymmetry Detection:**

```python
if not left_node or not right_node:
    return False
```

If only one node exists, we have asymmetry. This catches cases where one subtree is deeper than its mirror.

**3. The Core Logic:**

```python
return (left_node.val == right_node.val and
        are_mirrors(left_node.left, right_node.right) and
        are_mirrors(left_node.right, right_node.left))
```

This line encapsulates the entire mirror property:

* Values must match
* Left's left subtree mirrors Right's right subtree
* Left's right subtree mirrors Right's left subtree

### Tracing Through an Example

Let's trace through a symmetric tree:

```
      1
     / \
    2   2
   /   /
  3   3
```

**Call Stack Evolution:**

```
is_symmetric(root=1)
  └── are_mirrors(left=2, right=2)
      ├── left.val == right.val? → 2 == 2 ✓
      ├── are_mirrors(left.left=3, right.right=3)
      │   ├── 3 == 3 ✓
      │   ├── are_mirrors(None, None) → True ✓
      │   └── are_mirrors(None, None) → True ✓
      └── are_mirrors(left.right=None, right.left=None) → True ✓
```

## Algorithm 2: Iterative Mirror Detection

### The Iterative Approach

> **Why Iterative?** : In interview settings, you might be asked to solve this without recursion to avoid stack overflow issues or to demonstrate iterative thinking.

```python
from collections import deque

def is_symmetric_iterative(root):
    """
    Iterative solution using queue-based level-order traversal
  
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(w) where w is the maximum width of the tree
    """
    if not root:
        return True
  
    # Use a queue to store pairs of nodes that should be mirrors
    queue = deque([(root.left, root.right)])
  
    while queue:
        left_node, right_node = queue.popleft()
      
        # Both None - continue
        if not left_node and not right_node:
            continue
          
        # One None, one not - asymmetric
        if not left_node or not right_node:
            return False
          
        # Values don't match - not symmetric
        if left_node.val != right_node.val:
            return False
      
        # Add the next pairs to check
        # CRITICAL: Notice the cross-pairing for mirror property
        queue.append((left_node.left, right_node.right))
        queue.append((left_node.right, right_node.left))
  
    return True
```

### Understanding the Queue Logic

The key insight in the iterative solution is  **how we pair the nodes** :

```python
queue.append((left_node.left, right_node.right))  # Outer pairs
queue.append((left_node.right, right_node.left))  # Inner pairs
```

> **Critical Pattern** : We're always comparing nodes that should be mirror images. The left child of the left subtree should mirror the right child of the right subtree, and vice versa.

### Visual Queue Evolution

For tree:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```

**Queue states:**

```
Initial: [(2, 2)]
Step 1:  [(3, 3), (4, 4)]  # After processing (2, 2)
Step 2:  [(4, 4), (None, None), (None, None)]  # After processing (3, 3)
Step 3:  [(None, None), (None, None), (None, None), (None, None)]  # After processing (4, 4)
```

## Algorithm 3: Creating a Mirror Tree

### The Creation Problem

> **Problem Statement** : Given a binary tree, create its mirror image.

```python
def create_mirror(root):
    """
    Create a mirror image of the given binary tree
  
    Time Complexity: O(n) - visit each node once
    Space Complexity: O(h) - recursion stack depth
    """
    if not root:
        return None
  
    # Create a new node with the same value
    mirror_root = TreeNode(root.val)
  
    # Recursively create mirror subtrees with swapped positions
    mirror_root.left = create_mirror(root.right)
    mirror_root.right = create_mirror(root.left)
  
    return mirror_root
```

### In-Place Mirroring

Sometimes you're asked to mirror the tree in-place (modify the original):

```python
def mirror_in_place(root):
    """
    Mirror the tree in-place by swapping left and right children
  
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(h)
    """
    if not root:
        return None
  
    # Swap the children
    root.left, root.right = root.right, root.left
  
    # Recursively mirror the subtrees
    mirror_in_place(root.left)
    mirror_in_place(root.right)
  
    return root
```

### Step-by-Step Creation Example

Original tree:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 /   / \
4   5   6
```

**Creation process:**

```
Step 1: Create mirror_root(1)
Step 2: mirror_root.left = create_mirror(3)
        ├── Create node(3)
        ├── node(3).left = create_mirror(6) → node(6)
        └── node(3).right = create_mirror(5) → node(5)
Step 3: mirror_root.right = create_mirror(2)
        ├── Create node(2)
        ├── node(2).left = create_mirror(None) → None
        └── node(2).right = create_mirror(4) → node(4)
```

**Result:**

```
    1
   / \
  3   2
 / \   \
6   5   4
```

## Advanced Concepts and Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: Single Node Tree

```python
# Tree: [1]
# Result: True (single node is symmetric)

def test_single_node():
    root = TreeNode(1)
    assert is_symmetric(root) == True
```

### Edge Case 2: Empty Tree

```python
# Tree: []
# Result: True (empty tree is symmetric by definition)

def test_empty_tree():
    assert is_symmetric(None) == True
```

### Edge Case 3: Asymmetric by Structure

```python
# Tree:    1
#         / \
#        2   2
#       /     \
#      3       3
# Result: False (structure doesn't match)

root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(2)
root.left.left = TreeNode(3)
root.right.right = TreeNode(3)
# This is NOT symmetric because left.left doesn't mirror right.left
```

### Edge Case 4: Asymmetric by Values

```python
# Tree:    1
#         / \
#        2   3
# Result: False (values don't match)
```

## Complexity Analysis Deep Dive

### Time Complexity Analysis

> **For Detection Algorithms** : O(n) where n is the number of nodes
>
> **Reasoning** : We must visit each node at least once to verify the symmetric property. In the worst case (a perfectly symmetric tree), we visit every node exactly once.

### Space Complexity Analysis

 **Recursive Approach** : O(h) where h is the height of the tree

* Best case (balanced tree): O(log n)
* Worst case (skewed tree): O(n)

 **Iterative Approach** : O(w) where w is the maximum width of the tree

* Best case (skewed tree): O(1)
* Worst case (perfect binary tree): O(n/2) = O(n)

> **Interview Tip** : The space complexity trade-off between recursive and iterative approaches depends on the tree's shape. Discuss this with your interviewer!

## FAANG Interview Variations

### Variation 1: Count Symmetric Subtrees

```python
def count_symmetric_subtrees(root):
    """
    Count the number of symmetric subtrees in a binary tree
    """
    count = [0]  # Use list for mutable reference
  
    def is_subtree_symmetric(node):
        if not node:
            return True
      
        if is_symmetric(node):
            count[0] += 1
      
        is_subtree_symmetric(node.left)
        is_subtree_symmetric(node.right)
  
    is_subtree_symmetric(root)
    return count[0]
```

### Variation 2: Find the Largest Symmetric Subtree

```python
def largest_symmetric_subtree(root):
    """
    Find the size of the largest symmetric subtree
    """
    max_size = [0]
  
    def dfs(node):
        if not node:
            return 0
      
        left_size = dfs(node.left)
        right_size = dfs(node.right)
      
        if is_symmetric(node):
            current_size = 1 + left_size + right_size
            max_size[0] = max(max_size[0], current_size)
      
        return 1 + left_size + right_size
  
    dfs(root)
    return max_size[0]
```
