# Redis String Manipulation Commands: From First Principles

Let me explain Redis string manipulation commands from the ground up, building a clear understanding of how they work and why they're useful.

## What is Redis?

At its core, Redis is an in-memory data structure store. Unlike traditional databases that store data on disk, Redis keeps everything in memory, making it incredibly fast. Think of it as a sophisticated dictionary that lives in RAM rather than on your hard drive.

Redis was created to solve a fundamental problem: how to store and retrieve data with extremely low latency. When data needs to be accessed quickly and frequently, traditional databases can become bottlenecks.

## Understanding Redis Data Types

Before diving into string manipulation, let's understand where strings fit in Redis:

1. **Strings** : Basic key-value pairs (what we'll focus on)
2. **Lists** : Ordered collections of strings
3. **Sets** : Unordered collections of unique strings
4. **Sorted Sets** : Sets where each member has a score for ordering
5. **Hashes** : Maps of field-value pairs
6. **Streams** : Append-only collections of map entries
7. **Geospatial** : Longitude/latitude coordinates
8. **HyperLogLog** : Probabilistic data structure for cardinality estimation

## Redis Strings: The Foundation

In Redis, a string is the most basic data type. But don't let the name fool you - a Redis string can hold various data:

* Text (like "hello world")
* Integers (like 42)
* Floating-point numbers (like 3.14)
* Binary data (like images, serialized objects)

A Redis string can be up to 512MB in size - that's enough space for about 100 million characters!

## Basic String Commands

Let's start with the fundamental operations:

### 1. SET and GET

The most basic string operations are SET (to store a value) and GET (to retrieve it):

```redis
SET user:1:name "Alice"
GET user:1:name
```

What's happening here:

* `SET` creates a key called "user:1:name" with the value "Alice"
* `GET` retrieves the value stored at that key

We can also set multiple values at once:

```redis
MSET user:1:name "Alice" user:1:email "alice@example.com" user:1:age 30
MGET user:1:name user:1:email user:1:age
```

This is more efficient than multiple individual SET commands because it reduces network round trips.

### 2. Expiration and Existence

Redis can set values with an expiration time, which is perfect for caching:

```redis
SET session:token "abc123" EX 3600  # Key expires in 1 hour
TTL session:token                   # Returns seconds left until expiration
```

We can check if a key exists:

```redis
EXISTS user:1:name  # Returns 1 if exists, 0 otherwise
```

### 3. Incrementing and Decrementing

Redis handles numbers in strings specially:

```redis
SET counter 10
INCR counter        # Increases by 1, now 11
INCRBY counter 5    # Increases by 5, now 16
DECR counter        # Decreases by 1, now 15
DECRBY counter 3    # Decreases by 3, now 12
```

This is incredibly useful for counters, rate limiting, and other numeric tracking without worrying about race conditions. For floating-point increments:

```redis
SET pi 3.14
INCRBYFLOAT pi 0.01  # Now 3.15
```

## Advanced String Manipulation

Now let's explore more sophisticated string operations:

### 1. APPEND

We can add to existing strings:

```redis
SET greeting "Hello"
APPEND greeting " World"  # Now "Hello World"
```

This is useful for building log entries or accumulating text data.

### 2. Substring Operations with GETRANGE and SETRANGE

Extract portions of strings:

```redis
SET message "Hello Redis World"
GETRANGE message 6 10    # Returns "Redis"
```

Or modify portions:

```redis
SETRANGE message 6 "Awesome"  # Changes to "Hello Awesome World"
```

Let's break down how GETRANGE works:

* First parameter: the key
* Second parameter: start index (0-based)
* Third parameter: end index (inclusive)

So `GETRANGE message 6 10` extracts characters at positions 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.

### 3. String Length

Get the length of a string:

```redis
STRLEN message  # Returns the number of bytes in the string
```

For ASCII characters, this equals the number of characters. For multi-byte encodings like UTF-8, one character might take multiple bytes.

### 4. Bit Operations

Redis allows bit-level operations, which are extremely efficient for certain use cases:

```redis
SETBIT online:users 123 1  # Set bit at position 123 to 1
GETBIT online:users 123    # Get value of bit at position 123
BITCOUNT online:users      # Count set bits (1s)
```

This is perfect for tracking user activity (e.g., "which users were online today?") with minimal memory usage.

### 5. GETSET

Atomically set a new value and return the old one:

```redis
SET counter 10
GETSET counter 0  # Returns 10 and sets counter to 0
```

This is useful for retrieving and resetting a value in one operation.

## Practical Examples

Let's see how these commands work together in real-world scenarios:

### Example 1: Page View Counter

```redis
# User visits page
INCR pageviews:page:42

# Get current count
GET pageviews:page:42

# Reset daily counter at midnight
GETSET pageviews:daily:page:42 0
```

This tracks page views with minimal code, and the GETSET operation lets us retrieve the day's count while resetting it for tomorrow.

### Example 2: Rate Limiting API Calls

```redis
# When user makes API request
INCR ratelimit:user:1001
EXPIRE ratelimit:user:1001 60

# Check if limit exceeded
GET ratelimit:user:1001
```

If the returned value exceeds our threshold (e.g., 100 requests per minute), we reject the request. The EXPIRE command automatically clears the counter after 60 seconds.

### Example 3: Building a Simple Cache

```redis
# Check if data exists in cache
EXISTS cache:user:42

# If not, fetch from database and cache with expiration
SET cache:user:42 "{\"name\":\"Alice\",\"email\":\"alice@example.com\"}" EX 3600

# Retrieve from cache
GET cache:user:42
```

This implements a basic cache with automatic expiration.

## Performance Considerations

Redis string operations are blazingly fast:

* SET/GET: O(1) complexity - constant time
* INCR/DECR: O(1)
* APPEND: O(1) for small strings, may be O(N) for very large strings
* GETRANGE/SETRANGE: O(N) where N is the length of the returned string or modified section

When using string manipulation, consider:

1. **Memory usage** : Each key and value consumes memory
2. **Key naming** : Organize keys with namespaces (e.g., "user:1:name")
3. **Expiration** : Use TTL for transient data to prevent memory leaks

## Common Patterns and Best Practices

1. **Use MSET/MGET** for bulk operations to reduce network overhead
2. **Leverage atomicity** for counters and synchronized operations
3. **Set expiration times** for temporary data
4. **Use namespaced keys** to organize data (e.g., "user:1001:profile")
5. **Consider compression** for very large strings

## Comparing with Other Redis Data Types

When should you use strings versus other data types?

* **Strings** : For simple values, counters, or serialized objects
* **Hashes** : When you need a structured object with multiple fields
* **Lists** : For ordered collections that need push/pop operations
* **Sets/Sorted Sets** : For unique collections or leaderboards

## String Command Summary

Here's a quick reference of the main string commands we've covered:

* **SET/GET** : Basic storage and retrieval
* **MSET/MGET** : Multi-key operations
* **INCR/DECR** : Increment/decrement counters
* **APPEND** : Add to existing strings
* **GETRANGE/SETRANGE** : Substring operations
* **STRLEN** : Get string length
* **SETBIT/GETBIT** : Bit-level operations
* **GETSET** : Set new value, return old value

## Conclusion

Redis string manipulation commands provide a powerful toolset for fast, in-memory data operations. From simple key-value storage to complex bit operations, these commands enable efficient solutions for caching, counting, rate limiting, and many other use cases.
