# Understanding Column Constraints in PostgreSQL from First Principles

Column constraints in PostgreSQL are fundamental rules that govern what data can be stored in database columns. They act as gatekeepers, ensuring data integrity by enforcing specific conditions that values must satisfy before being accepted into the database.

> Think of constraints as a form of data validation at the database level - they create guardrails that prevent incorrect or problematic data from entering your system in the first place.

Let's explore the three key column constraints in PostgreSQL: NOT NULL, DEFAULT, and CHECK.

## NOT NULL Constraint

### The Fundamental Concept

At its core, the NOT NULL constraint prevents a column from accepting null values. A null in database terms represents the absence of a value â€” not zero, not an empty string, but truly  *nothing* .

> Nulls represent the unknown or inapplicable. They're fundamentally different from empty values because they indicate the absence of any value whatsoever.

### How It Works

When you define a column with NOT NULL, PostgreSQL will reject any INSERT or UPDATE operation that would place a null in that column.

Let's see it in action:

```sql
-- Creating a table with a NOT NULL constraint
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

In this example, the `first_name` and `last_name` columns cannot be null, while the `email` column can.

What happens if we try to violate this constraint?

```sql
-- This will fail because first_name is NOT NULL
INSERT INTO employees (last_name, email)
VALUES ('Smith', 'john.smith@example.com');
```

PostgreSQL will respond with an error similar to:

```
ERROR:  null value in column "first_name" of relation "employees" violates not-null constraint
DETAIL:  Failing row contains (1, null, Smith, john.smith@example.com).
```

### Real-World Applications

NOT NULL is particularly useful for:

1. Required identification fields (usernames, IDs)
2. Critical business data (transaction amounts, customer names)
3. Foreign keys that must point to a valid record

### Adding NOT NULL to Existing Columns

If you have an existing table, you can add a NOT NULL constraint:

```sql
-- Adding NOT NULL to an existing column
ALTER TABLE employees 
ALTER COLUMN email SET NOT NULL;
```

However, this will only work if no existing rows contain NULL values in that column.

## DEFAULT Constraint

### The Fundamental Concept

The DEFAULT constraint defines what value a column should automatically receive when no value is explicitly specified during insertion.

> Think of DEFAULT as setting the starting position for a column when you don't provide specific instructions.

### How It Works

When inserting a new row, if you don't specify a value for a column with a DEFAULT constraint, PostgreSQL will use the default value instead.

```sql
-- Creating a table with DEFAULT constraints
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    in_stock BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

In this example:

* `in_stock` defaults to `true`
* `created_at` defaults to the current timestamp

When inserting without specifying these fields:

```sql
-- Only providing name and price
INSERT INTO products (name, price)
VALUES ('Ergonomic Keyboard', 89.99);

-- Let's see what was inserted
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = 'Ergonomic Keyboard';
```

The result would be:

```
 product_id |        name        | price  | in_stock |        created_at      
------------+--------------------+--------+----------+--------------------------
          1 | Ergonomic Keyboard |  89.99 | true     | 2025-05-15 10:23:45.123
```

The `in_stock` and `created_at` columns received their default values automatically.

### Default Value Types

PostgreSQL supports various types of default values:

1. **Constants** : `DEFAULT 0`, `DEFAULT 'Unknown'`, `DEFAULT true`
2. **Functions** : `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, `DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()`
3. **Expressions** : `DEFAULT price * 0.1` (with limitations)

### Adding or Changing Defaults

You can modify default values for existing columns:

```sql
-- Setting a default for an existing column
ALTER TABLE products
ALTER COLUMN price SET DEFAULT 0.00;

-- Removing a default
ALTER TABLE products
ALTER COLUMN in_stock DROP DEFAULT;
```

## CHECK Constraint

### The Fundamental Concept

The CHECK constraint is the most flexible of the three. It allows you to define a Boolean condition that all values in a column must satisfy.

> A CHECK constraint acts like a security guard who examines each piece of data against a specific rule before letting it into the database.

### How It Works

Any attempt to insert or update data in a column with a CHECK constraint will first evaluate the condition. If the condition returns false, the operation is rejected.

```sql
-- Creating a table with CHECK constraints
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    order_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    quantity INTEGER CHECK (quantity > 0),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (price >= 0),
    status VARCHAR(20) CHECK (status IN ('Pending', 'Processing', 'Shipped', 'Delivered', 'Cancelled'))
);
```

In this example:

* `quantity` must be greater than zero
* `price` must be non-negative
* `status` must be one of five allowed values

Let's try some operations:

```sql
-- This will succeed
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, quantity, price, status)
VALUES (1001, 5, 250.00, 'Pending');

-- This will fail (negative quantity)
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, quantity, price, status)
VALUES (1002, -3, 150.00, 'Processing');

-- This will fail (invalid status)
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, quantity, price, status)
VALUES (1003, 2, 120.00, 'Lost');
```

The failed insertions would produce errors like:

```
ERROR:  new row for relation "orders" violates check constraint "orders_quantity_check"
DETAIL:  Failing row contains (2, 1002, 2025-05-15, -3, 150.00, Processing).
```

### Complex Check Conditions

CHECK constraints can be quite sophisticated:

```sql
-- More complex CHECK constraints
CREATE TABLE employees_extended (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    birth_date DATE CHECK (birth_date > '1900-01-01' AND birth_date < CURRENT_DATE),
    hire_date DATE CHECK (hire_date >= birth_date + INTERVAL '18 years'),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (salary >= 0),
    manager_id INTEGER,
    CHECK (manager_id <> employee_id) -- Cannot be their own manager
);
```

Here we have multiple checks:

* Birth date must be after 1900 and before today
* Hire date must be at least 18 years after birth date
* Salary must be non-negative
* An employee cannot be their own manager

### Named vs. Unnamed CHECK Constraints

In the examples above, we created unnamed CHECK constraints. You can also give them names for easier reference:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products_with_named_checks (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    weight DECIMAL(5, 2),
    CONSTRAINT positive_price CHECK (price > 0),
    CONSTRAINT reasonable_weight CHECK (weight > 0 AND weight < 1000)
);
```

Named constraints make it easier to identify which constraint was violated and to alter or drop them later.

### Adding CHECK Constraints to Existing Tables

You can add CHECK constraints to existing tables:

```sql
-- Adding a CHECK constraint to an existing column
ALTER TABLE products
ADD CONSTRAINT price_range CHECK (price >= 0 AND price <= 10000);
```

This will only succeed if all existing data satisfies the condition.

## Combining Constraints for Data Integrity

These constraints are most powerful when used together. Let's see a comprehensive example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE inventory (
    item_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Uncategorized',
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 CHECK (quantity >= 0),
    unit_price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (unit_price > 0),
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    CONSTRAINT valid_category CHECK (category IN ('Electronics', 'Furniture', 'Office Supplies', 'Uncategorized'))
);
```

In this table:

* `name` must be provided (NOT NULL)
* `category` has a default but also must be one of four values (DEFAULT + CHECK)
* `quantity` can't be NULL, defaults to 0, and must be non-negative (NOT NULL + DEFAULT + CHECK)
* `unit_price` must be provided and must be positive (NOT NULL + CHECK)
* `last_updated` automatically gets the current time if not specified (DEFAULT)

## Practical Considerations and Advanced Usage

### Performance Implications

Constraints do add overhead to INSERT and UPDATE operations, as PostgreSQL must validate each constraint. However, this cost is typically minimal compared to the benefits of data integrity.

### Error Handling

When constraints are violated, PostgreSQL stops the operation and returns an error. In application code, you should handle these potential errors:

```python
try:
    # Pseudo-code for database operation
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES (%s, %s)", 
                  ["Fancy Widget", -5.99])
    connection.commit()
except psycopg2.Error as e:
    print(f"Database error: {e}")
    connection.rollback()
```

### Temporary Disabling Constraints

In rare cases, you might need to temporarily disable constraints for bulk operations:

```sql
-- Disable constraint checking for a session
SET CONSTRAINTS ALL DEFERRED;

-- Do your operations...

-- Re-enable constraint checking
SET CONSTRAINTS ALL IMMEDIATE;
```

This should be used very cautiously, as it bypasses your data integrity safeguards.

### Conditional Constraints

PostgreSQL also supports partial CHECK constraints that only apply to certain rows:

```sql
-- A conditional CHECK constraint
CREATE TABLE premium_products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    is_premium BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    warranty_months INTEGER,
    CHECK (NOT is_premium OR warranty_months >= 12)
);
```

This constraint only requires a warranty of at least 12 months for premium products.

## Summary

> Database constraints are your first line of defense against data corruption. They encode business rules directly into your database structure, ensuring consistency regardless of which application or user interacts with the data.

To recap:

1. **NOT NULL** : Ensures a column always contains a value
2. **DEFAULT** : Provides an automatic value when none is specified
3. **CHECK** : Enforces a Boolean condition on values

These constraints work together to maintain data integrity, which is essential for building reliable applications. By understanding and properly implementing these constraints, you're putting fundamental database principles into practice and creating a solid foundation for your data.
