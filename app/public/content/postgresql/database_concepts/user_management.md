# User Management and Authentication in PostgreSQL: From First Principles

## Understanding the Foundation

> "Security is not a product, but a process." - Bruce Schneier

PostgreSQL's security model is built upon a solid foundation of user management and authentication principles. To truly understand these concepts, we need to start from the absolute beginning.

### What is Authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or application that wants to access a database. It answers the fundamental question: "Are you who you claim to be?"

Think of authentication as the front door to your house. Before letting someone in, you want to verify their identity:

1. You might look through a peephole (password authentication)
2. You might check their ID card (certificate authentication)
3. You might recognize their face (peer authentication)

In PostgreSQL, this verification process happens before a user can even connect to the database.

## PostgreSQL Users and Roles: The Fundamental Building Blocks

In PostgreSQL, the concepts of users and roles are central to access control. Let's break this down:

> A role is an entity that can own database objects and have database privileges. A role can be considered a "user", a "group", or both depending on how it's used.

Since PostgreSQL 8.1, "users" and "roles" are essentially the same thing with one subtle difference: a "user" is simply a role with login privileges.

### Creating Your First Role

Here's a simple example of creating a role:

```sql
-- Create a basic role without login privileges
CREATE ROLE reporting;

-- Create a role with login privileges (a "user")
CREATE ROLE alice WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'secure_password';

-- Alternative syntax specifically for users
CREATE USER bob WITH PASSWORD 'another_secure_password';
```

Let me explain what's happening in this code:

* The first command creates a role named "reporting" without login privileges - this might be used as a group to assign permissions.
* The second command creates a role named "alice" with login privileges and a password - this is effectively a user.
* The third command is equivalent to `CREATE ROLE bob WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'another_secure_password'` - the `CREATE USER` syntax is just a shortcut.

## Authentication Methods: Multiple Ways to Verify Identity

PostgreSQL supports various authentication methods, each with different security characteristics. Let's explore the most common ones:

### 1. Password Authentication

This is the most basic form of authentication, where users provide a password to verify their identity.

PostgreSQL supports several password authentication methods:

* **md5** : Passwords are stored as MD5 hashes (older method)
* **scram-sha-256** : More secure method using SCRAM-SHA-256 (recommended)
* **password** : Plain text passwords (avoid in production!)

Here's how to create a user with a password:

```sql
-- Create a user with SCRAM-SHA-256 password encryption
CREATE USER sarah WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password' PASSWORD_ENCRYPTION 'scram-sha-256';

-- Check the encryption method
SELECT rolname, rolpassword FROM pg_authid WHERE rolname = 'sarah';
```

In this example:

* We're creating a user named "sarah"
* We're explicitly specifying SCRAM-SHA-256 encryption (the current default in recent PostgreSQL versions)
* The second command lets us verify the password is stored in the encrypted format

### 2. Certificate Authentication

For more secure environments, PostgreSQL supports SSL certificate authentication:

```sql
-- First, configure PostgreSQL to use SSL
-- This would be in postgresql.conf:
-- ssl = on
-- ssl_cert_file = 'server.crt'
-- ssl_key_file = 'server.key'

-- Then in pg_hba.conf:
-- hostssl all all 0.0.0.0/0 cert
```

This method requires:

* Proper SSL setup on the server
* Distributing client certificates
* Configuring clients to use their certificates

### 3. Peer Authentication

On local systems, PostgreSQL can authenticate users based on their operating system username:

```bash
# As OS user 'john', connect to PostgreSQL
psql -U john mydatabase
```

With peer authentication configured, this would only work if the PostgreSQL username 'john' matches the operating system username 'john'.

## The pg_hba.conf File: The Authentication Gatekeeper

> The pg_hba.conf file is where all the authentication rules are defined. It's the gatekeeper that determines who can connect and how they must authenticate.

Let's look at a simple pg_hba.conf example:

```
# TYPE  DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS      METHOD
local   all       all                peer
host    all       all   127.0.0.1/32 scram-sha-256
host    sales     bob   10.0.0.0/24  scram-sha-256
hostssl all       all   0.0.0.0/0    cert
```

Breaking down this configuration:

1. Local connections use peer authentication
2. Local network connections use password authentication with SCRAM-SHA-256
3. User 'bob' can connect to the 'sales' database from the 10.0.0.0/24 network using a password
4. All other connections must use SSL certificates

The pg_hba.conf file is read from top to bottom, and the first matching rule is applied.

## Role-Based Access Control: Building a Permissions Structure

PostgreSQL uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage permissions. This is where the distinction between "users" and "groups" becomes useful.

Let's look at how to build a simple role hierarchy:

```sql
-- Create group roles for different access levels
CREATE ROLE readonly;
CREATE ROLE readwrite;
CREATE ROLE admin;

-- Grant appropriate permissions to each role
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly;
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readwrite;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE company TO admin;

-- Create user roles
CREATE USER john WITH PASSWORD 'john_password';
CREATE USER jane WITH PASSWORD 'jane_password';
CREATE USER alice WITH PASSWORD 'alice_password';

-- Assign users to appropriate groups
GRANT readonly TO john;
GRANT readwrite TO jane;
GRANT admin TO alice;
```

In this example:

* We create three "group" roles with different permission levels
* We create three users with login capabilities
* We assign each user to the appropriate group, giving them the corresponding permissions

This structure makes permission management much more maintainable. If you need to add a new read-only user, you simply create the user and grant them the 'readonly' role.

## User Attributes: Fine-Tuning Role Capabilities

PostgreSQL roles can have various attributes that control what they can do:

```sql
-- Create a superuser (dangerous in production!)
CREATE ROLE admin WITH SUPERUSER LOGIN PASSWORD 'admin_password';

-- Create a role that can create databases but not other roles
CREATE ROLE developer WITH CREATEDB LOGIN PASSWORD 'dev_password';

-- Create a role with a password that expires
CREATE ROLE temporary WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'temp_password' VALID UNTIL '2023-12-31';

-- Create a role with connection limits
CREATE ROLE api_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'api_password' CONNECTION LIMIT 10;
```

Breaking down these examples:

* SUPERUSER gives all privileges (like root in Linux)
* CREATEDB allows the role to create new databases
* VALID UNTIL sets an expiration date for the role's password
* CONNECTION LIMIT restricts the number of simultaneous connections

## Password Management: Best Practices

Managing passwords securely is crucial. Here are some examples of password management operations:

```sql
-- Change a user's password
ALTER ROLE john WITH PASSWORD 'new_secure_password';

-- Set password to expire
ALTER ROLE john VALID UNTIL '2023-12-31';

-- Force password change on next login (PostgreSQL 10+)
ALTER ROLE john WITH PASSWORD 'temporary_password' VALID UNTIL 'infinity';
-- And then in pg_hba.conf, use the 'password_encryption=scram-sha-256 password_reuse_max=0 password_reuse_time=0' options
```

> Important: Always use strong passwords and consider implementing a password policy, especially in production environments.

## Practical Implementation: A Complete Example

Let's put it all together with a practical example of setting up users for a typical web application:

```sql
-- Create group roles
CREATE ROLE app_readonly;
CREATE ROLE app_readwrite;
CREATE ROLE app_admin;

-- Set up schema and permissions
CREATE SCHEMA app;

-- Grant schema usage to all roles
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA app TO app_readonly, app_readwrite, app_admin;

-- Create some tables
CREATE TABLE app.users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE app.posts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES app.users(id),
    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Set up permissions for readonly role
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA app TO app_readonly;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA app GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO app_readonly;

-- Set up permissions for readwrite role
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA app TO app_readwrite;
GRANT USAGE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA app TO app_readwrite;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA app 
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO app_readwrite;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA app 
    GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCES TO app_readwrite;

-- Set up permissions for admin role (includes schema modification)
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA app TO app_admin;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA app TO app_admin;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA app TO app_admin;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA app GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLES TO app_admin;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA app GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SEQUENCES TO app_admin;

-- Create application roles
CREATE USER app_reader WITH PASSWORD 'reader_password';
CREATE USER app_writer WITH PASSWORD 'writer_password';
CREATE USER app_administrator WITH PASSWORD 'admin_password';

-- Assign users to their roles
GRANT app_readonly TO app_reader;
GRANT app_readwrite TO app_writer;
GRANT app_admin TO app_administrator;
```

This comprehensive example:

1. Creates three group roles with different permission levels
2. Sets up a schema and tables for the application
3. Grants appropriate permissions to each role
4. Creates user accounts for different functions
5. Assigns users to the appropriate roles

Notice how we use `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` to ensure that new tables and sequences automatically get the right permissions.

## Authentication in Connection Strings: Connecting to the Database

Now that we have users set up, how do we connect to the database? Here are examples in different programming languages:

### Python (with psycopg2)

```python
import psycopg2

# Connect as app_writer
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    dbname="mydatabase",
    user="app_writer",
    password="writer_password",
    host="localhost",
    port="5432"
)

# Use the connection
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute("INSERT INTO app.posts (user_id, title, content) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)", 
            (1, "My First Post", "Hello, PostgreSQL!"))
conn.commit()
cur.close()
conn.close()
```

In this Python example:

* We're creating a connection to the database using the app_writer credentials
* We're then using that connection to insert a new post
* The database server will authenticate the user based on the pg_hba.conf rules

### Node.js (with pg)

```javascript
const { Pool } = require('pg')

// Create a connection pool as app_reader
const pool = new Pool({
  user: 'app_reader',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'mydatabase',
  password: 'reader_password',
  port: 5432,
})

// Query the database
async function getPosts() {
  const client = await pool.connect()
  try {
    const result = await client.query('SELECT * FROM app.posts')
    console.log(result.rows)
  } finally {
    client.release()
  }
}

getPosts()
```

In this Node.js example:

* We're setting up a connection pool with the app_reader credentials
* We're then executing a SELECT query to retrieve posts
* The app_reader role only has SELECT permissions, so it can read but not modify data

## Advanced Authentication Features

### Row-Level Security: Fine-Grained Access Control

PostgreSQL's Row-Level Security (RLS) allows you to control which rows a user can see or modify:

```sql
-- Enable row-level security on the posts table
ALTER TABLE app.posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a policy that only allows users to see their own posts
CREATE POLICY user_posts ON app.posts
    USING (user_id = (SELECT id FROM app.users WHERE username = current_user));

-- Allow admins to see all posts
CREATE POLICY admin_posts ON app.posts
    TO app_admin
    USING (true);
```

This example:

* Enables row-level security on the posts table
* Creates a policy that only allows users to see posts they created
* Creates a second policy that gives admins access to all posts

### Managing Connection Limits and Timeouts

To prevent resource exhaustion, you can set connection limits:

```sql
-- Set connection limit for a role
ALTER ROLE app_writer CONNECTION LIMIT 5;

-- Set global connection settings in postgresql.conf:
-- max_connections = 100
-- idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = '10min'
-- statement_timeout = '30s'
```

These settings help prevent:

* Too many connections overwhelming the server
* Abandoned transactions locking resources
* Long-running queries consuming too much CPU

## Troubleshooting Authentication Issues

When authentication fails, PostgreSQL provides error messages that can help diagnose the problem:

```
ERROR:  password authentication failed for user "john"
ERROR:  no pg_hba.conf entry for host "192.168.1.100", user "alice", database "company"
```

Common troubleshooting steps include:

1. Check the pg_hba.conf file for the correct entry
2. Verify the user exists: `SELECT * FROM pg_roles WHERE rolname = 'username';`
3. Check if the password is correct (by trying to connect)
4. Look at the PostgreSQL logs for detailed error information

```bash
# View recent log entries
tail -n 100 /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-14-main.log
```

Here's the output format you might see (in portrait/vertical orientation for mobile):

```
2023-01-15 14:25:32.651 UTC [5432] 
  FATAL:  password authentication 
  failed for user "john"
2023-01-15 14:25:40.123 UTC [5432] 
  LOG:  connection authorized: 
  user=alice database=company
```

## Best Practices for PostgreSQL Authentication

> Security is a journey, not a destination. These best practices will help you maintain a secure PostgreSQL environment.

1. **Use role hierarchies** - Create group roles for permissions and user roles for login
2. **Implement least privilege** - Give users only the permissions they need
3. **Use strong authentication** - Prefer scram-sha-256 or certificate authentication
4. **Regularly audit user accounts** - Remove unused accounts and review permissions
5. **Secure the pg_hba.conf file** - Restrict it to only necessary connections
6. **Use SSL for remote connections** - Encrypt data in transit
7. **Implement connection pooling** - Use pgBouncer or similar tools for production

## Conclusion

User management and authentication in PostgreSQL build upon fundamental security principles while providing flexible ways to implement access control. By understanding these concepts from first principles, you can create a secure and maintainable database environment.

Remember that authentication (verifying identity) is just the first step. Authorization (determining what authenticated users can do) is equally important and is managed through PostgreSQL's permission system.
