# PostgreSQL: Basics of SQL Syntax and Statement Structure

I'll explain PostgreSQL's SQL syntax and statement structure from first principles, building up your understanding step by step with clear examples and detailed explanations.

## What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. Before diving into syntax, let's understand what makes SQL special:

> SQL is declarative rather than procedural. This means you specify *what* data you want, not *how* to get it. The database engine figures out the most efficient way to execute your query.

PostgreSQL (often called "Postgres") is an advanced, open-source relational database system that extends the SQL standard with additional features.

## SQL Statements: The Building Blocks

Every interaction with a PostgreSQL database happens through SQL statements. Think of these statements as complete sentences that tell the database what you want to do.

### Statement Categories

SQL statements fall into several categories:

1. **Data Definition Language (DDL)** - Defines database structure
   * CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE
2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** - Manages data
   * SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
3. **Data Control Language (DCL)** - Controls access
   * GRANT, REVOKE
4. **Transaction Control** - Manages transactions
   * COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

## Basic Statement Structure

Let's explore the fundamental structure of SQL statements through examples.

### 1. SELECT Statement - The Foundation

The SELECT statement retrieves data from a database. It's the most common SQL statement and has this basic structure:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ... 
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

Let's break this down with a simple example:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Engineering';
```

This statement:

* Specifies which columns we want (`first_name` and `last_name`)
* Names the source table (`employees`)
* Filters rows with a condition (`department = 'Engineering'`)

The semi-colon at the end marks the statement's completion.

> The SELECT statement forms the basis of querying in SQL. Understanding it well sets you up for success with more complex queries.

### 2. INSERT Statement - Adding Data

The INSERT statement adds new rows to a table:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

For example:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, department, hire_date)
VALUES ('Maria', 'Garcia', 'Marketing', '2023-06-15');
```

This statement:

* Names the target table (`employees`)
* Lists columns to populate
* Provides corresponding values in the same order

You can insert multiple rows in a single statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, department)
VALUES 
    ('James', 'Smith', 'Sales'),
    ('Robert', 'Johnson', 'Sales'),
    ('Lisa', 'Wong', 'Finance');
```

### 3. UPDATE Statement - Modifying Data

The UPDATE statement modifies existing data:

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

For example:

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET department = 'Product Management', 
    salary = salary * 1.1
WHERE employee_id = 103;
```

This statement:

* Identifies the table to update
* Specifies new values for columns
* Uses a WHERE clause to target specific rows

> **Important** : Without a WHERE clause, UPDATE affects ALL rows in the table, which is rarely what you want. Always double-check your WHERE conditions!

### 4. DELETE Statement - Removing Data

The DELETE statement removes rows from a table:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

For example:

```sql
DELETE FROM customers
WHERE last_order_date < '2020-01-01';
```

This statement:

* Names the table to delete from
* Uses a WHERE clause to specify which rows to remove

> As with UPDATE, a DELETE without a WHERE clause will delete ALL rows from the table. Use with extreme caution!

### 5. CREATE TABLE Statement - Defining Structure

The CREATE TABLE statement defines a new table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 data_type constraints,
    column2 data_type constraints,
    ...
);
```

For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    price NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

This statement:

* Names the new table (`products`)
* Defines columns with their data types and constraints
* Sets `product_id` as the primary key with auto-incrementing values
* Makes `name` and `price` required (NOT NULL)
* Gives `created_at` a default value of the current time

## PostgreSQL Data Types

PostgreSQL offers a rich set of data types. Here are the most common ones:

* **Numeric types** :
* `INTEGER` - whole numbers
* `SERIAL` - auto-incrementing integer
* `NUMERIC(p,s)` - exact numbers with p digits, s after decimal
* `REAL`, `DOUBLE PRECISION` - floating-point numbers
* **Character types** :
* `CHAR(n)` - fixed-length string
* `VARCHAR(n)` - variable-length string with limit
* `TEXT` - unlimited-length string
* **Date/Time types** :
* `DATE` - date only
* `TIME` - time only
* `TIMESTAMP` - date and time
* `INTERVAL` - period of time
* **Boolean type** :
* `BOOLEAN` - true/false values
* **Other common types** :
* `JSON`, `JSONB` - JSON data
* `UUID` - universally unique identifiers
* `ARRAY` - array of values
* `BYTEA` - binary data

## Query Clauses and Order

Let's look at the full structure of a SELECT query with all possible clauses:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
JOIN another_table ON join_condition
WHERE row_filter_condition
GROUP BY column1, column2, ...
HAVING group_filter_condition
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...
LIMIT count
OFFSET skip;
```

These clauses must appear in this specific order. Let's explore each one:

### The FROM Clause

The FROM clause specifies the tables from which to retrieve data:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, department_name
FROM employees
JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

This query:

* Gets data from the `employees` table
* Joins it with the `departments` table
* Matches rows where the department IDs match

### The WHERE Clause

The WHERE clause filters rows based on conditions:

```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
WHERE price > 100 AND category = 'Electronics';
```

Common operators in WHERE clauses:

* Comparison: `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
* Logical: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
* Pattern matching: `LIKE`, `ILIKE`, `SIMILAR TO`
* Range: `BETWEEN`, `IN`
* Null checking: `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`

### The GROUP BY Clause

GROUP BY groups rows with the same values:

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

This query:

* Groups employees by department
* Counts how many employees are in each department

### The HAVING Clause

HAVING filters groups based on conditions:

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 75000;
```

This query:

* Groups employees by department
* Calculates average salary for each department
* Shows only departments with average salary above $75,000

> Think of HAVING as a WHERE clause for grouped results. WHERE filters individual rows before grouping, while HAVING filters groups after they're formed.

### The ORDER BY Clause

ORDER BY sorts the results:

```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC, product_name ASC;
```

This query:

* Sorts products by price in descending order (highest first)
* For products with the same price, sorts by name in ascending order

### The LIMIT and OFFSET Clauses

LIMIT restricts the number of rows returned:

```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This shows the 10 most expensive products.

OFFSET skips a number of rows:

```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

This shows products 21-30 when sorted by price (useful for pagination).

## Practical Examples

Let's see some practical examples that combine multiple concepts:

### Example 1: Customer Order Analysis

```sql
SELECT 
    c.customer_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders,
    SUM(o.order_amount) AS total_spent,
    MAX(o.order_date) AS last_order_date
FROM 
    customers c
JOIN 
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE 
    o.order_date >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id, c.customer_name
HAVING 
    COUNT(o.order_id) >= 3
ORDER BY 
    total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

This query:

* Joins customers with their orders
* Filters for orders placed in 2023 or later
* Calculates total orders, amount spent, and latest order for each customer
* Includes only customers with at least 3 orders
* Shows the top 5 customers by total spent

### Example 2: Product Inventory Management

```sql
SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    p.price,
    COALESCE(SUM(i.quantity), 0) AS total_inventory,
    CASE
        WHEN COALESCE(SUM(i.quantity), 0) = 0 THEN 'Out of stock'
        WHEN COALESCE(SUM(i.quantity), 0) < 10 THEN 'Low stock'
        ELSE 'In stock'
    END AS stock_status
FROM 
    products p
LEFT JOIN 
    inventory i ON p.product_id = i.product_id
GROUP BY 
    p.product_id, p.product_name, p.price
ORDER BY 
    stock_status, p.product_name;
```

This query:

* Joins products with inventory (using LEFT JOIN to include products with no inventory)
* Calculates total inventory for each product
* Creates a stock status label based on inventory levels
* Orders results by stock status and product name

## PostgreSQL Specific Features

PostgreSQL extends standard SQL with many powerful features:

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs create named temporary result sets:

```sql
WITH recent_customers AS (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM orders
    WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
)
SELECT 
    c.customer_name,
    c.email
FROM 
    customers c
JOIN 
    recent_customers rc ON c.customer_id = rc.customer_id;
```

This query:

* Creates a temporary result set of customers with orders in the last 30 days
* Joins it with the customers table to get their details

### Window Functions

Window functions perform calculations across rows:

```sql
SELECT 
    department,
    employee_name,
    salary,
    AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS dept_avg_salary,
    salary - AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS diff_from_avg
FROM 
    employees;
```

This query:

* Shows each employee's salary
* Calculates the average salary for their department
* Shows how much their salary differs from the department average

### JSON Functions

PostgreSQL has excellent JSON support:

```sql
SELECT 
    product_id,
    product_name,
    metadata->>'manufacturer' AS manufacturer,
    (metadata->>'ratings')::numeric AS rating
FROM 
    products
WHERE 
    metadata->'tags' ? 'organic';
```

This query:

* Extracts manufacturer and rating from a JSON metadata field
* Filters for products tagged as "organic"

## SQL Style Conventions

While SQL is case-insensitive for keywords, following these conventions improves readability:

* Write SQL keywords in UPPERCASE
* Write table and column names in lowercase (or camelCase, or snake_case)
* Use meaningful table and column names
* Indent clauses consistently
* Use line breaks to separate logical parts of the query
* Comment complex SQL for clarity

For example:

```sql
-- Find high-value customers who haven't ordered recently
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    c.email,
    MAX(o.order_date) AS last_order_date,
    SUM(o.order_amount) AS total_spent
FROM
    customers c
JOIN
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE
    c.status = 'active'
GROUP BY
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    c.email
HAVING
    SUM(o.order_amount) > 1000
    AND MAX(o.order_date) < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
ORDER BY
    total_spent DESC;
```

## Final Thoughts

Understanding PostgreSQL's SQL syntax and statement structure is the foundation for working effectively with databases. Start simple and gradually build up to more complex queries as you become comfortable with the basics.

> SQL's power comes from its combination of simplicity and expressiveness. With just a few statement types and clauses, you can perform incredibly complex data operations.

Remember that the PostgreSQL documentation is an excellent resource when you need to look up specific syntax or features. It's comprehensive and well-written.
