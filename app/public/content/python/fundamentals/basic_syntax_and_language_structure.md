# Python Basic Syntax and Language Structure: A First Principles Approach

I'll guide you through Python's basic syntax and language structure, starting from absolute first principles and building up your understanding step by step. Let's dive deep into the foundations of Python.

> Programming is giving instructions to a computer. Python is simply a specific language with rules for how those instructions should be structured. Think of it as learning the grammar and vocabulary of a new language, where the audience is a computer rather than a human.

## The Philosophy Behind Python

Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s with a philosophy summarized in "The Zen of Python":

> Beautiful is better than ugly.
>
> Explicit is better than implicit.
>
> Simple is better than complex.
>
> Readability counts.

This philosophy shapes everything about Python's design, from its clean syntax to its emphasis on readability.

## Starting With the Most Basic Element: Expressions

At its core, programming is about evaluating expressions. An expression is anything that produces a value.

```python
# Simple expressions
5           # A number
"Hello"     # A string (text)
5 + 3       # Addition (produces 8)
```

When you type an expression in Python's interactive mode (REPL), it evaluates it and shows you the result:

```python
>>> 5
5
>>> "Hello"
'Hello'
>>> 5 + 3
8
```

The `>>>` is Python's prompt, indicating it's ready for your input. The line below each expression shows the result.

## Statements: Telling Python to Do Something

While expressions produce values, statements are complete instructions that tell Python to do something.

```python
# This is a statement - it assigns the value 5 to the variable x
x = 5

# This statement prints text to the screen
print("Hello, world!")
```

The key difference is that statements perform actions but don't necessarily produce values that can be used in other expressions.

## Variables: Storing and Referencing Values

Variables are names that refer to values. Think of them as labeled containers:

```python
# Creating variables
name = "Alice"    # 'name' now refers to the string "Alice"
age = 30          # 'age' now refers to the integer 30

# Using variables in expressions
print(name)       # Outputs: Alice
print(age + 5)    # Outputs: 35
```

Variables in Python:

1. Don't need to be declared before use
2. Don't have fixed types (can refer to any kind of data)
3. Must start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, numbers, or underscores
4. Are case-sensitive (`name` and `Name` are different variables)

## Indentation: Python's Block Structure

Unlike many languages that use braces `{}` to define blocks of code, Python uses indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line).

```python
# This if statement has a block of code indented under it
if age > 18:
    print("You are an adult")    # This is part of the if block
    print("You can vote")        # This is also part of the if block
print("This runs regardless")    # Outside the if block, always runs
```

> Indentation is not just a style choice in Pythonâ€”it's a fundamental part of the syntax. The standard is to use 4 spaces per level of indentation.

## Comments: Annotations for Humans

Comments are notes for humans reading the code. Python ignores them during execution:

```python
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a multi-line comment
or docstring when used at the beginning
of a function, class, or module
"""

x = 5  # Comments can also appear at the end of a line
```

## Data Types: The Building Blocks

Python has several built-in data types:

### 1. Numbers

```python
# Integers (whole numbers)
age = 30

# Floating-point numbers (decimals)
height = 1.75

# Complex numbers
complex_num = 3 + 4j

# Examples of operations
sum = 10 + 5          # Addition: 15
difference = 10 - 5   # Subtraction: 5
product = 10 * 5      # Multiplication: 50
quotient = 10 / 5     # Division: 2.0 (always returns a float)
floor_div = 10 // 3   # Floor division: 3 (discards remainder)
remainder = 10 % 3    # Modulo (remainder): 1
power = 10 ** 2       # Exponentiation: 100
```

### 2. Strings (Text)

```python
# Different ways to define strings
single_quotes = 'Hello'
double_quotes = "World"
triple_quotes = """This string
can span multiple
lines"""

# String operations
greeting = "Hello" + " " + "World"   # Concatenation: "Hello World"
repeated = "Echo " * 3               # Repetition: "Echo Echo Echo "

# String indexing (accessing characters)
first_char = greeting[0]             # 'H' (indexing starts at 0)
last_char = greeting[-1]             # 'd' (negative indices count from end)

# String slicing (extracting substrings)
substring = greeting[0:5]            # "Hello" (from index 0 up to but not including 5)
```

### 3. Booleans (True/False)

```python
# Boolean values
is_adult = True
is_minor = False

# Boolean operations
and_result = True and False          # False (both must be True)
or_result = True or False            # True (at least one must be True)
not_result = not True                # False (negation)

# Comparison operations yield boolean results
equal = (5 == 5)                     # True
not_equal = (5 != 10)                # True
greater = (10 > 5)                   # True
less_or_equal = (5 <= 5)             # True
```

### 4. None (Null/Empty)

```python
# None represents the absence of a value
result = None

# Checking for None
is_none = (result is None)           # True
```

### 5. Collections

#### Lists (Ordered, Mutable Sequences)

```python
# Creating a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Accessing elements
first_fruit = fruits[0]               # "apple"

# Modifying lists
fruits.append("orange")               # Adds "orange" to the end
fruits[1] = "blueberry"               # Changes the second item

# List operations
combined = fruits + ["grape", "kiwi"] # Concatenation
fruit_count = len(fruits)             # Length: 4
```

#### Tuples (Ordered, Immutable Sequences)

```python
# Creating a tuple
coordinates = (10, 20)

# Accessing elements
x_coord = coordinates[0]              # 10

# Tuples cannot be modified after creation
# coordinates[0] = 15  # This would cause an error
```

#### Dictionaries (Key-Value Pairs)

```python
# Creating a dictionary
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Accessing values
name = person["name"]                 # "Alice"

# Modifying dictionaries
person["email"] = "alice@example.com" # Adds a new key-value pair
person["age"] = 31                    # Updates an existing value
```

#### Sets (Unordered Collections of Unique Items)

```python
# Creating a set
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Adding to a set
unique_numbers.add(6)                 # Adds 6 to the set

# Set operations
unique_numbers.add(3)                 # No effect (3 is already in the set)
has_three = 3 in unique_numbers       # True
```

## Control Flow: Making Decisions and Repeating Actions

### Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)

```python
# Basic if statement
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")

# if-else statement
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
else:
    print("You are a minor")

# if-elif-else statement (multiple conditions)
if age < 13:
    print("You are a child")
elif age < 18:
    print("You are a teenager")
else:
    print("You are an adult")
```

Let's break down how this works:

1. Python evaluates the condition after `if`
2. If the condition is `True`, it executes the indented block
3. If the condition is `False`, it skips that block and checks the next condition (if there is one)

### Loops: Repeating Actions

#### While Loops

```python
# While loop (continues until condition becomes False)
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f"Count is {count}")
    count += 1  # Same as count = count + 1
```

This will output:

```
Count is 0
Count is 1
Count is 2
Count is 3
Count is 4
```

The loop continues as long as `count < 5` is `True`. Each iteration increases `count` by 1 until it reaches 5, at which point the condition becomes `False` and the loop stops.

#### For Loops

```python
# For loop (iterates over a sequence)
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}")
```

This will output:

```
I like apple
I like banana
I like cherry
```

The `for` loop automatically iterates through each item in the sequence, assigning it to the variable `fruit` for each iteration.

### Loop Control Statements

```python
# Break (exits the loop)
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break       # Stops the loop when i equals 5
    print(i)        # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Continue (skips the rest of the current iteration)
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:  # If i is even
        continue    # Skip the rest of this iteration
    print(i)        # Prints 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
```

## Functions: Reusable Blocks of Code

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

```python
# Defining a function
def greet(name):
    """This function greets the person with the given name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Calling the function
message = greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```

Let's break down this function:

1. `def` keyword starts the function definition
2. `greet` is the function name
3. `(name)` is the parameter list (what the function accepts)
4. The indented block is the function body
5. `return` specifies what value the function gives back when called

### Functions with Multiple Parameters

```python
# Function with multiple parameters
def calculate_total(price, tax_rate, discount=0):
    """
    Calculate the total price after tax and discount.
  
    Args:
        price: The original price
        tax_rate: The tax rate (e.g., 0.1 for 10%)
        discount: Optional discount amount (default 0)
  
    Returns:
        The total price
    """
    taxed_price = price * (1 + tax_rate)
    final_price = taxed_price - discount
    return final_price

# Different ways to call this function
total1 = calculate_total(100, 0.1)            # Using positional arguments
total2 = calculate_total(price=100, tax_rate=0.1, discount=10)  # Using keyword arguments
total3 = calculate_total(100, 0.1, 10)        # Mixing styles
```

## Modules and Imports: Using External Code

Python's power comes partly from its large standard library and ecosystem of third-party packages. You access these through imports:

```python
# Importing an entire module
import math
radius = 5
area = math.pi * radius ** 2
print(area)  # Approximately 78.54

# Importing specific items from a module
from math import pi, sqrt
area = pi * radius ** 2
diagonal = sqrt(10)

# Importing with an alias
import math as m
circumference = 2 * m.pi * radius
```

## Exception Handling: Dealing with Errors

When errors occur in Python, they raise exceptions. You can handle these using try-except blocks:

```python
# Basic exception handling
try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / number
    print(f"10 divided by {number} is {result}")
except ValueError:
    print("That's not a valid number!")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
except:
    print("Something else went wrong")
finally:
    print("This runs no matter what")
```

This code attempts to get a number from the user and perform a division. If the user enters something that's not a number, a `ValueError` occurs. If they enter zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs. The appropriate exception handler will then execute.

## Putting It All Together: A Complete Example

Let's combine many of these concepts into a simple program:

```python
def calculate_grades(scores):
    """Calculate letter grades from numerical scores."""
    grades = []
    for score in scores:
        if score >= 90:
            grades.append('A')
        elif score >= 80:
            grades.append('B')
        elif score >= 70:
            grades.append('C')
        elif score >= 60:
            grades.append('D')
        else:
            grades.append('F')
    return grades

def main():
    # Get student scores
    student_scores = []
    try:
        num_students = int(input("How many students? "))
        for i in range(num_students):
            score = float(input(f"Enter score for student {i+1}: "))
            student_scores.append(score)
      
        # Calculate and display grades
        grades = calculate_grades(student_scores)
        print("\nResults:")
        for i, (score, grade) in enumerate(zip(student_scores, grades)):
            print(f"Student {i+1}: Score = {score}, Grade = {grade}")
      
        # Calculate average
        average = sum(student_scores) / len(student_scores)
        print(f"\nClass average: {average:.2f}")
  
    except ValueError:
        print("Error: Please enter valid numbers.")
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: No students to calculate average.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

# Run the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program:

1. Defines a function to calculate letter grades from scores
2. Has a main function that:
   * Gets student scores from user input
   * Calculates their grades
   * Displays the results
   * Calculates and displays the class average
3. Handles potential errors with exception handling
4. Uses the special `if __name__ == "__main__":` idiom to run the main function when the script is executed directly

## Key Takeaways on Python Syntax and Structure

> Python's philosophy emphasizes readability and simplicity, which is reflected in its clean, minimalist syntax. The language design makes heavy use of whitespace and indentation to define code blocks, reducing visual clutter and encouraging consistent formatting.

Here are the key elements we've covered:

1. **Expressions vs. Statements** : Expressions produce values; statements perform actions
2. **Variables** : Named references to values, dynamically typed
3. **Indentation** : Defines code blocks, typically 4 spaces
4. **Data Types** : Numbers, strings, booleans, None, and collections
5. **Control Flow** : Conditional statements and loops
6. **Functions** : Reusable blocks of code with parameters and return values
7. **Modules and Imports** : Accessing external code
8. **Exception Handling** : Dealing with errors gracefully

Understanding these fundamentals gives you the building blocks to write Python programs of any complexity. Python's design philosophy encourages clear, readable code that expresses intent directlyâ€”often referred to as "Pythonic" code.
